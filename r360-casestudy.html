            </div>
            <p>I was initially brought on as a UX Designer and Front-End Developer to conceptualize, design, and build this remote monitoring web application for the company's machining/fabrication products.</p>
            <p><div class="col-md-12 animate-box" data-animate-effect="fadeInLeft">
            <div class="col-md-12 text-center animate-box"> <img src='images/ignition.png' width="90%"><br><br></div>
          </div></p>
            <p>The concept for this application already existed when I was hired. It was a Desktop, Java-based application which was extremely limited. It was built by a third-party company, who currently serves as the Iot Solutions Provider. The company does not specialize in design and front-end development, so there was a need to hire an in-house designer & developer. Going from a full in-house design & development team from Tire Rack to being the only UX/UI designer & front-end expert, was definitely a daunting and intimidating thought. However, this project gave me the opportunity to build a solution that ultimately would test my creative abilities and task myself with the entire process. </p>

            </div>
            <p>I was new to the machining/fabrication industry; a beast that I did not quite understand. However, the company's business model was pretty standard. The company initially developed remote360 to fill a need to cut back on spending in the Service department. The target users for this product are rural and urban consumers in the fabrication/machining industry. These users were looking to gain real-time insight on their machines, without having to manually log information on Excel spreadsheets. These users were looking for convenience and therefore were seeking a mobile-first, fast, real-time monitoring solution. Excel spreadsheets just don't cut it anymore.</p>
           <p style="text-align: center;">After meeting customers, product managers and technicians, we were able to construct a typical User Persona for current and future users:</p>

            </div>
            <p>I was hired into the company's Business Systems team, comprised of a back-end developer/system admin, network support technician, and department manager who initially conceptualized the idea and worked closely with the Iot partner to build the first iteration.</p>
            <p>I coordinated and led all facets of design and development including: information architecture, ux flows, interaction, visual, product, prototyping, mockups, and front-end development. I also conducted user research using methods such as interviews with company engineers, technicians, sales reps, department managers, and upper management. I employed participatory design with local customers who provided feedback as to what they would like to see on the application that would help their processes and address both user behavior and attitudes.</p>

            </div>
            <p>In order to identify if this product was worth developing, that company would need to see the revenue benefit and accomplish the goal of providing customers with a solution that would actually be beneficial and improve productivity as a result. The initial java-based iteration provided a proof of concept that was well received within the initial pool of laser customers it was released to, they just craved a better user experience.</p>
            <p>What did the current application do well? To gain a full understanding of the experience to-date, we recruited a range of current remote360 users. Veteran users told us what the product does well, while new users highlighted pain points in the app that we could improve upon in order to turn them into avid users and product advocates.</p>
            <p>After sifting through all the feature requests from company personnel and customers, we decided as a team to bring this concept to the web and to meet launch deadlines, we would build and improve the current features from the Java application. Although we knew that the app could grow to be something much larger and more robust, we focused on creating an MVP that met the user’s core need.</p>
         
         <div class="col-md-12 text-center animate-box"> <img src='images/wireframes.jpg' width="100%"><br><br></div>
          <p>Based on the feedback we were able to construct an ideal user flow in such a way that there was a minimal level of difficulty to immediately access relevant information, which was the goal because this enabled users to quickly and easily consume information. </p>

              <h2 class="portfolio-heading">User Interface Design</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Using an A/B Testing approach, I presented a few theme options to various technicians, product managers, and upper managment. After narrowing and eliminating, the overall consensus was introducing a dark theme to the interface, which I was in favor of. It was the preferred theme overall and gave a fresh take on the product.</p>

            <p>The objective of the interface was to introduce a trendy, exciting, and modern design. I reimagined the entire interface gaining inspiration from design trends in admin dashboards, provided multiple theme options, rounded corners, removing tacky photography & designing new product line icons, generic (Font Awesome) icons, and more.</p>

            </div>
            <p>I took the existing primary colors from the Java application, and translated them into practical, consistent usage. The red, green and yellow had very traditional values and were strong. I gave them a more of a pastel treatment so they were easier on the eyes. I added a secondary and tertiary color to be used as primaries for supporting information.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The primary goal for this product was to become web-based. The company wanted me to employ modern standards when building the app. Programming includes: HTML5, SCSS/CSS, and JavaScript; PHP and MySQL were used to work with data. Being the designer and developer, I was able to develop the product with big picture knowledge, which streamlined my entire process. </p>

            </div>

            <p>The final product was a success. Before launch, we conducted beta testing with several local customers who provided feedback in a timely manner. The application was well received, and provided customers with real-time insight into their production. Many UI and UX improvements and additions have been made since initial launch, including simplifying colors used, fonts, improved data visualizations.</p>
            <div class="col-md-12 text-center animate-box"> <img src='images/reports.png' width="100%"> </div>
            <p>Recent additions to the applications include brochures and monthly production PDF reports that users may receive in their e-mail inbox.</p>
            <p>The application has been a hit now going into 2020, making headlines in popular news outlets in the industry:
